## Abstract:

Stem cell therapies are promising for diverse clinical indications. However, there are manufacturing and reimbursement challenges that must be addressed towards widespread adoption. This thesis presents TESSEE, a new tool for early health technology assessment (eHTA), supported on bioprocess and/or health economics models. TESSEE is developed specifically for stem cell therapies, incorporating biological, process, clinical, and economic uncertainty. Unlike other eHTA, TESSEE is an open source tool, freely available and customizable to several case studies. In order to develop and demonstrate the different features of TESSEE, at the moment, three industrially and clinically relevant case studies were published in academic journals.

## Pre-Installation Requirements

TESSEE is a cross platform tool that requires a Python 3 implementation and a text editor to run. The Anaconda implementation of Python 3 is recommended. For a Text Editor, Sublime Text 3 is also recommended.

Steps:

1 - Install [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
       
 NOTE: In case you are running Anaconda on a Windows operating system, it is required to [change the Path variables to add Anaconda](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444)
    
2 - Install [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

3 - Open the Command Window/Terminal in your operating system

4 - Insert the following commands on your Command Window/Terminal. Each command should be followed by Enter


        $conda update conda
        $conda update numpy
        $conda update pandas
        $conda update scipy
        $python -m pip install simpy


## Installation

There are two ways to install/download the source code of TESSEE to your local machine:

<b>Using GitHub (requires [pre-installation of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in your machine):</b>

1 - Open the Command Window/Terminal in your operating system
    
2 - Change the directory to download the TESSEE source code on your command window:
    

    $cd <Insert path to desired location>

        
3 - Clone the Git repository 


    $ git clone https://github.com/catiabandeiras/TESSEE.git


<b>Direct download as a ZIP folder</b>

1 - Click on the [root GitHub repository of TESSEE](https://github.com/catiabandeiras/TESSEE)

2 - Click on the green "Clone or download" button

3 - Select "Download ZIP"

4 - Unzip the folder and copy to your desired location on your local machine.

## Credits

Credits in the development of this tool are given to the PhD supervisors of [Catia Bandeiras](http://scerg.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cbandeiras.html): [Prof. Dr. Frederico Ferreira (iBB-IST)](http://scerg.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/fcferreira.html) and [Prof. Dr. Stan Neil Finkelstein (IDSS-MIT and DCI-BIDMC-HMS)](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/stan-finkelstein/). 

Additionally, members of the [Stem Cell Engineering Research Group](http://scerg.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/index.html) provided important feedback on the development of this tool due to their lab expertise in Stem Cell Manufacturing. Furthermore, members of the Cell Therapy Core Facilities at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/), [Harvard Stem Cell Institute](https://hsci.harvard.edu/), and [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/) also provided feedback, along with several industry members.

Invaluable feedback on cost-effectiveness models on type 1 diabetes and cystic fibrosis was provided by clinicians at the [Joslin Diabetes Center](https://www.joslin.org/), [Boston Children's Hospital](http://www.childrenshospital.org/), and [Indiana University School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/).
